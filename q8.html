      <h2>Understanding Bus Transport System</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          Bus transportation plays a vital role in daily commuting. With fixed routes and affordable pricing, buses serve millions of people across urban and rural areas. From city transport to intercity travel, the reach of buses is extensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Government buses often follow strict schedules, while private buses offer flexibility and comfort. Bus passes are available for students, senior citizens, and regular commuters, making public transport more economical.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the rise of smart transport, many bus systems now support GPS tracking, digital ticketing, and mobile apps to track timings. Safety and efficiency are increasingly becoming a focus in modern transportation networks.
